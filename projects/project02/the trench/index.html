       <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
       <p class="body-text" style="font-size: 40px; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: white;">Alright, so you made it into the water, that's a good start. </p>
        <p class="body-text">From here on out I'm gonna start referring to our depth in meters, just 'cause I want to and it's my website so there. </p>
        <p class="body-text">Oh! And before we get too far below the water, you may have noticed that your cursor isn't visible. <br> That's because it's about to get a whole lot darker, but luckily I've brought along a nice flashlight you can use, <br> if you can figure out your orientation that is. </p>
        <p class="body-text-dark">Here, why don't you try it now, hover of THIS TEXT. </p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark">Everything look good? Great. Now we can start scrolling–err–I mean... diving... to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, hold on! </p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark" style="text-align: left;">For now it seems that we have a decent amount of light. That's because we're <br> in what's called the Epipelagic Zone, otherwise known as the 'Sunlight Zone'.  </p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark" style="text-align: right;">From zero to around two-hundred meters below the the surface <br>of the ocean, this is where you will find the majority of <br>marine life as we know it: fishies, sharks, sea turtles, billionaire's yachts, etc. </p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark" style="text-align: left;">Alright, so now we are entering the Mesopelagic Zone, also called the Twilight Zone.  </p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark" style="text-align: right;"> This area extends from 200 to 1000m below the water's surface. <br>Here you can find the maximum depth limit of diving suits, military submarines, and sperm whales. Don't laugh at that, they're very majestic sea creatures y'know.</p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark">Now heres the Bathypelagic Zone, also called the Midnight Zone, and for good reason. You should probably be using your flashlight exclusively now. <br>This zone extends from 1000 to 4000 meters below the surface, feeling the pressure yet?</p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark" style="text-align: right;"> Oops, seems like on onboard lights have turned, oh well, seems like we only have the <br>light from your flashlight now. No more selfies for you!</p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark" style="text-align: left;">And here's Abyssopelagic Zone, extending from 4000 to 6000 meters below the surface below the water.  </p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark">Yes, I know its also referred to as 'The Abyss' but that's just an old myth to scare away these amateur–I mean PROFESSIONAL– explorers from traversing the Mariana Trench. </p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark" style="text-align: right;">Hey, did you know that in 2009 that the Mariana Trench was established as a US National Monument? <br>Kind of a weird place to put a United States' NATIONAL mounument, y'know, <br>out here in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, closer to the Phillipines than San Francisco. </p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark"> You still with me? Right now we're passing 3,800 meters below the water's surface, <br>this is where the RMS Titanic rests. Well, not RIGHT here but at around the same depth somewhere over in the Atlantic.</p>
        <div class="brlarge" style="text-align: left;"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark"> Speaking of the Titanic, I heard James Cameron is doing one of his deep sea excursions today, maybe we'll run into him, hmm? </p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark" style="text-align: right;"> And now we are passing 4,267 meters, the average depth of the world's oceans. <br>Lucky for us this voyage has just begun.</p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark"> And here we're now finally entering The Trenches themselves, known as te Hadal Zone, extending from 6,000 to 11,000 meters below the surface.</p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark"> Not a whole lot down here, right? Pretty dark too...</p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark" style="text-align: left;">  The movement of the Pacific and Mariana plates is also indirectly responsible for the formation of the Mariana Islands. <br>These volcanic islands are caused by flux melting of the upper mantle <br>due to the release of water that is trapped in minerals of the subducted portion of the Pacific Plate.</p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark" style="text-align: right;"> The trench was first sounded during the Challenger expedition in 1875 using a weighted rope, which recorded a depth of 4,475 fathoms (8,184 metres; 26,850 feet). We just passed that mark, so screw them HA!</p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark"> Here we are at 8848 meters below the surface, this is the equivalent to the height of Mount Everest. <br> Ain't that neat!</p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark" style="text-align: left;"> The Mariana Trench is named after the nearby Mariana Islands, <br>which are named Las Marianas in honor of Spanish Queen Mariana of Austria. <br> The islands are part of the island arc that is formed on an over-riding plate, <br> called the Mariana Plate (also named for the islands), on the western side of the trench.</p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <img src="DEEPSEA-CHALLENGER--001.webp" alt="James" class="center">
        <p class="body-text-dark"> Oh hey look, it IS James Cameron. Funny running into him way down here at 10,898 meters below the surface. <br><br> Well, let's not hang around too long, I'm sure he's working on something pretty important. </p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark" style="text-align: right;"> Did you know, at the bottom of the trench, the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi),<br> more than 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. <br>At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%. The temperature at the bottom is 1 to 4 °C (34 to 39 °F).</p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark"> Yes, I just read all of that off of Wikipedia but that's kind of the point of this project...</p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark"> Hey, did you know that some governments have thought about using this trench as a nuclear waste dumping site? <br>All proposals have been rejected, but I feel like I just saw a yellow barrel of some glowing green ooze float by.</p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark" style="text-align: right;"> I may also just be hallucinating so there's that.</p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark"> Oh, haha, you'll think this is pretty funny, looks like we're almost out of oxygen and I'm done to my last set of AA batteries for my controller.  <br><br> This may be the end of this journey, but I appreciated your company and more importantly your money.</p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark" style="text-align: right;"> Oh wait hey! I know you can scroll all the way back up but c'mon, <br>at least stick around with me for a little bit? </p>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <div class="brlarge"><br></div>
        <p class="body-text-dark"> Alright, I'm screwed, go back to the homepage or something, see you in hell.</p>
