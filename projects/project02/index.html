    <h1 class="main-title">Welcome to the Mariana Trench</h1>
    <h3 class="sub-heading">well, at least the surface of it...</h3>
    <p class="body-text"><span>T</span>hats right! You are now 200km (124 miles for the burger eaters) east of the Mariana Islands, somewhere in the western Pacific Ocean. Now don't worry, this trip is insured, and we've brought along a crew of highly trained subaquatic explorers to help you travers the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. <br> Yes, they are using a Logitech controller they bought off of Amazon for $18 but I promise you they won't get lost (because the only direction is down after all). <br>
    Now please, gather your belongings and go to the bathroom one last time, because there isn't going to be one at the bottom of the trench. And remember although 2,550 km (1,580 miles) may seem like a long distance, just think about it as running 60 marathons... in the dark </p>
